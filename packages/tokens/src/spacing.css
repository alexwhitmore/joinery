/**
 * Joinery Spacing Tokens
 * 
 * Semantic spacing based on relationship between elements, not arbitrary values.
 * Choose based on *intent*: how related are these elements?
 * 
 * tight    → Inline elements, icon + text, tightly coupled items
 * related  → Items that belong together (form field + label, card content)
 * distinct → Separate but grouped (cards in a grid, list items)
 * section  → Major content divisions within a page
 * page     → Page-level separation (hero to content, footer gap)
 * 
 * Based on a ~2x progression for simplicity:
 * 0.25 → 0.75 → 1.5 → 3 → 6
