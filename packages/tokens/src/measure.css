/**
 * Joinery Measure Tokens
 * 
 * Controls maximum line length for readability.
 * Uses `ch` unit (character width) so measure adapts to font size.
 * 
 * From "The Elements of Typographic Style": 
 * Optimal measure is 45-75 characters per line.
 * 
 * narrow → Sidebars, captions, constrained spaces
 * prose  → Body text, articles, primary reading content
 * wide   → Tables, code blocks, data-heavy content
